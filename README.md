# Phonebook

A Phonebook app made in Flutter. It uses the [DIO package](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) to get, post, update, and delete contacts from the [Phonebook-API](https://github.com/zimbaldi/phonebook-api). 

As soon as you open the app, it loads the contacts from the API. If you click in the contact card, it loads the edit page, with the fiels filled with the contact data to edit, but if you click on the Floating Action Button, it opens the edit page with clean fields to create a new contact. And when you swipe the contact card to the side, it deletes this contact.
